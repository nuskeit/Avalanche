# Avalanche

Avalanche is a "Consolidated Documentation App", to integrate the different diagramas and the technical docs, all in one synchronized document, to prevent the small snowballs to become a documentation killer avalanche.

## Author: Adrian Nuske

## Dev platform: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

# Some of the issues Avalanche addresses: 
1. Quick diagram build
2. Clear elements connections to avoid overlaps, not having the need to manually arange the "lines" of the diagram
3. Managing dev bundles as used in the projects: components, classes, functions, etc.
3. Automatically linking any relevant data to make sure you'll never have two different pieces of documentation about the same matter.
4. Takes action and / or asks for intervention when a change might propagate towards the rest of the documentation bundle.
